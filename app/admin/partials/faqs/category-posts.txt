### How do I make a mosaic from posts in a category? {.title}

You can create a gallery from the posts in a category by setting the 'category' attribute on your shortcode to the slug/name of the category you'd like to use.  You must also set the 'limit' to be number of posts you'd like to include.  PhotoMosaic will use each post's Featured Image.

`[photomosaic category="uncategorized" limit="20"]`

By default, mosaics built from a 'category' will link to each image's post.  This could, potentially, override your current 'link_behavior', 'lightbox', and 'custom_lightbox' global settings.  Setting 'link_behavior' inline on the shortcode will prevent this, causing your 'lightbox' and 'custom_lightbox' to fallback to their global settings (or the inline value if set).

For example, assuming my global settings has images opening in a lightbox when clicked (link_behavior="image", lightbox="1") :

- `[photomosaic category="uncategorized" limit="20"]`
	- images will link to that image's post
	- all lightbox settings will be ignored

- `[photomosaic category="uncategorized" limit="20" link_behavior="image"]`
	- images will link to the large version of the image
	- all lightbox settings will be honored

To find a category's slug :

* in the Admin, visit the 'All Posts' page (wp-admin/edit.php)
* select the Categories you'd like to use from the 'View All Categories' select box
* the URL for the page should include "?category_name=" (e.g. "?category_name=uncategorized")

A few more examples :

| Category        | Admin URL                      | Slug            |
|-----------------|--------------------------------|-----------------|
| Trips           | ?category_name=trips           | trips           |
| Favorite Places | ?category_name=favorite-places | favorite-places |
| 123!@#          | ?category_name=123             | 123             |
