### How do I make a PhotoMosaic? {.title}

PhotoMosaic is an extention of the `[gallery]` shortcode.  Simply make a `[gallery]` as you would normally.  On the "Edit Gallery" page of the "Create Gallery" workflow you can select "PhotoMosaic" in the "Theme" setting.

Any existing `[gallery]` can become a PhotoMosaic simply by specifying the 'theme' --> `[gallery theme="photomosaic"]` (either by editing the shortcode or by editing the gallery).

See [Where do I create/edit my galleries?](#createedit) for more detail.
See [Where can I get step-by-step instructions for making a gallery](#stepbystep) for step-by-step instructions.

A mosaic can also be made from the Featured Images of the most recent posts `[photomosaic category="recent" limit="20"]` or from a specific category of posts `[photomosaic category="uncategorized" limit="20"]`.

See [How do I make a mosaic of my recent posts?](#recentposts) for more detail.

NextGen users must use the `[photomosaic]` shortcode.  Specifiy a gallery ID `[photomosaic nggid="1"]` or an album ID `[photomosaic ngaid="1"]` to be displayed.

See [How does PhotoMosaic work with NextGen Galleries?](#nextgen) for more detail.
