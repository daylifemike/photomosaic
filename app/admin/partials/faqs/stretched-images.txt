### Why isn't PhotoMosaic using my Wordpress Thumbnails? {.title}

In order to prevent stretching and distorting your images, and to make it possible to seamlessly switch between different image resolutions (in responsive situations), PhotoMosaic needs all of the resolutions available for each image to have the same aspect ratio.  When PhotoMosaic detects that the aspect ratios for each image's thumbnail and full-size don't match, it ignores the thumbnail.  If you'd like PhotoMosaic to use the thumbnail, when it makes sense to do so, simply follow the steps below to regenerate your thumbnails so that they have the same aspect ratio as their full-size counterparts.


#### Wordpressâ€™s Gallery Users

Go to your Media Settings (Settings > Media).  If "Crop thumbnail to exact dimensions (normally thumbnails are proportional)" is checked that's the source of your problem.  To fix it you'll need to uncheck that box, save those changes, and then regenerate your thumbnails. 

If "Crop thumbnail to exact dimensions (normally thumbnails are proportional)" isn't checked, it's likely that your images were uploaded before you changed the "Thumbnail Size" values and you haven't regenerated your thumbnails.  Simply regenerating your thumbnails should solve the problem.

To regenerate your thumbnails I recommend the "Regenerate Thumbnails" plugin by Viper007Bond.  Once installed and activated, you can regenerate all of your thumbnails by going to Tools (Tools > Regen. Thumbnails) and clicking the button.  This will replace all of your cropped thumbnails with the new uncropped version.

If you want to regenerate the thumbnails for specific images, this can be done in the Media Library (Media > Library) by selecting the images you wish to regenerate and choosing "Regenerate Thumbnails" in the "Bulk Actions" menu.


#### NextGen Gallery Users

Go to your Gallery Options (Gallery > Options).  If "Set Fixed Dimension" is checked that's the source of your problem.  To fix it you'll need to uncheck that box, save those changes, and regenerate your thumbnails.

To regenerate your thumbnails go to the "Manage Gallery" page, select all of your images, and choose "Create New Thumbnails" from the "Bulk Actions" menu.
