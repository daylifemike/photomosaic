### ChangeLog for GitHub Updater

#### 2.5.0

* added `class GitHub_Updater_Bitbucket_API` for Bitbucket hosted plugins and themes.
* improvements to efficiency by not loading when `DOING_AJAX`
* improvements to efficiency in use of transients

#### 2.4.5

* set PHP MarkdownExtra posts and comments markup to false props @MikeHansonMe
* remove WP plugin header from `markdown.php`

#### 2.4.4

 * forgot to include markdown.php - damn

#### 2.4.2

 * removed PHP Markdown Lib as it required PHP >= 5.3 and that's higher than required by WordPress core.

#### 2.4.1

 * switched from PHP Markdown Classic to the new PHP Markdown Lib to prevent collisions with other plugins, like Markdown On Save/Improved that also load PHP Markdown or PHP MarkdownExtra.

#### 2.4.0

 * fixed transient assignment for tags returning empty array.
 * added transient for `CHANGES.md` to themes, should further cut down on API 403 errors.
 * new feature: theme rollback to previous version thanks @scarstens
 * changed update methodology to use most recent tag first. If not tagged update from default branch.

#### 2.3.3

 * fixed download link to have correct base URI for Repository Contents API. Oops.

#### 2.3.2
 
 * rewrite of `GitHub_Update_GitHub_API::construct_download_link` to download zipball and provide appropriate endpoint.

#### 2.3.1

 * now saving transient and adding early return if API returns 404, this should speed up plugin when repo doesn't have `CHANGES.md` file and provide for early return in no tags have been created. If no tags have been created the API is still hit.

#### 2.3.0

 * moved action hook to remove `after_theme_row_$stylesheet` to `class GitHub_Theme_Updater`
 * added feature: if branch other than `master` is specified then tagged version will be ignored. This should make it much easier for beta testing to groups. See [README.md](https://github.com/afragen/github-updater/blob/develop/README.md)
 * converted `class GitHub_Update_GitHub_API` to extension of `class GitHub_Updater`
 * combined `description` and `changelog` to show in theme detail view. Rough formatting. Multisite only.
 * greatly simplified bug fix from 2.2.2, now using Themes API.

#### 2.2.2

 * removed extra line endings from `remote_version`
 * added ratings function for creating star ratings based upon GitHub repo data.
 * bring parts of `class GitHub_Theme_Updater` code on par with `class GitHub_Plugin_Updater`

 * ripped out theme rollback code. Moved to it's own branch on GitHub.
 * add custom `after_theme_update_{$stylesheet}` detail.

#### 2.1.0

 * simplify check for `class Markdown_Parser`

 * fix for setting branch when API not responding
 * fix for setting download link when API not responding
 * redesigned filter for setting transient timeout, but still not working (pull requests welcome)

#### 2.0.1

 * minor spelling fixes
 * renamed some functions for their hooks
 * refactored `class GitHub_Plugin_Updater` and `class GitHub_Theme_Updater` to use stdClass objects 
 * further refactored base class `GitHub_Updater` to contain renaming code and create stdClass objects for data.
 * added some ability to see changelog for GitHub hosted plugins.
 * trying to follow <a href="https://github.com/tommcfarlin/WordPress-Plugin-Boilerplate">WordPress Plugin Boilerplate</a>, so renamed `classes` to `includes`
 * refactored putting all remote api calls in new `class GitHub_Plugin_Updater_API`.

 * added some variable declarations
 * added early return in no GitHub sourced plugins or themes are identified

#### 1.8.0

#### 1.7.4

 * changed method of not overwriting extra headers to pass array.

#### 1.7.3

 * change `'...'` to `&#8230` in renaming notification
 * fix to not overwrite extra headers of other plugins.

#### 1.7.2

 * removed sorting option from `scandir`. Doesn't work with older versions of PHP < 5.4.0
 * removed extraneous data from array in `multisite_get_themes`

#### 1.7.1

 * updated the transient for themes
 * replaced `readdir` with `scandir` for creating WP\_Theme object in multisite

#### 1.7.0

 * updated class-theme-updater.php to utilize WP\_Theme class

 * `get_remote_tag` uses transient to limit calls to API
 * fix for `wp_get_themes` not working under plugin network activation on multisite installation. I recreated `wp_get_themes` by reading in the theme directory and adding the WP\_Theme object of `wp_get_theme( 'dir_in_themes_dir' )` to an array.
