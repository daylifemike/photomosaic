# GitHub Updater

A simple plugin to enable automatic updates to your GitHub or Bitbucket hosted WordPress plugins and themes.

This plugin is not allowed in the wp.org repo. :frowning:

## Description

This plugin was designed to simply update any GitHub hosted WordPress plugin or theme. Your plugin or theme **must** contain a header in the style.css header or in the plugin's header denoting the location on GitHub. The format is as follows. The folder name of the theme or plugin **must** be the same as the repo name.

`GitHub Theme URI: afragen/test-child`  
`GitHub Theme URI: https://github.com/afragen/test-child`

or 

`GitHub Plugin URI: afragen/github-updater`  
`GitHub Plugin URI: https://github.com/afragen/github-updater`

...where the above URI leads to the __owner/repository__ of your theme or plugin. The URI may be in the format `https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>` or the short format `<owner>/<repo>`.

## Requirements
 * WordPress 3.4 (tested up to 3.9)

## Usage

### Themes

There must be a `GitHub Theme URI` or `Bitbucket Theme URI` declaration in the `style.css` file.

~~~css
/*
Theme Name:       Test
Theme URI:        http://drfragen.info/
Version:          0.1.0
Description:      Child theme of TwentyTwelve.

Template:         twentytwelve
Template Version: 1.0.0
GitHub Theme URI: https://github.com/afragen/test-child
GitHub Branch:    master
*/
~~~

### Plugins 

There must be a `GitHub Plugin URI` or `Bitbucket Plugin URI` declaration in the plugin's header.

~~~php
/*
Plugin Name:       GitHub Updater
Plugin URI:        https://github.com/afragen/github-updater
Description:       A plugin to automatically update GitHub hosted plugins and themes into WordPress. Plugin class based upon <a href="https://github.com/codepress/github-plugin-updater">codepress/github-plugin-updater</a>.

*/
~~~

Optional headers `GitHub Access Token`, `GitHub Branch` and `Bitbucket Branch` are available but not required.

## Tagging

If `GitHub Branch` or `Bitbucket Branch` is not specified (or is set to `master`), then the latest tag will be used. GitHub Updater will preferentially use a tag over a branch in this instance.

## Branch Support

To specify a branch that you would like to use for updating, just add a `GitHub Branch` header.  If you develop on `master` and are pushing tags, GitHub Updater will update to the newest tag. If there are no tags or the specified branch is not `master` GitHub Updater will use the specified branch for updating.

The default state is either `GitHub Branch: master` or nothing at all. They are equivalent.

If you want to update against branch of your repository other than `master` and have that branch push updates out to users make sure you specify the testing branch in a header, i.e. `GitHub Branch: develop`. When you want users to update against the release branch just have them manually change the header to `GitHub Branch: master` or remove it completely. Tags will be ignored when a branch other than `master` is specified. In this case I would suggest semantic versioning similar to the following, `<major>.<minor>.<patch>.<development>`.

## Bitbucket Support

The `Bitbucket Branch` header is supported for both plugins and themes.

### Bitbucket Plugin Support

Instead of the `GitHub Plugin URI` header you will need to use the `Bitbucket Plugin URI` header.

### Bitbucket Theme Support

Instead of the `GitHub Theme URI` header you will need to use the `Bitbucket Theme URI` header.

## Private Repositories

### GitHub Private Repositories

In order to specify a private repository you will need to obtain a [personal access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new). Once you have this, simply add the header `GitHub Access Token: xxxxxxxxx` to your plugin or theme.

### Bitbucket Private Repositories

I'm still working on this. :wink:

## Filter Hooks

There is a filter hook to set the number of hours for a transient to expire. You can add this to any plugin that you wish to override the default transient expiration. Add an appropriate integer to the anonymous function of the number of hours before expiration of the transient. Default is one hour. Usage as follows.

    add_filter( 'github_updater_set_transient_hours', function() { return 3; } );
    
### NB - This does not work. Pull requests welcome.
