### How do I make a PhotoMosaic? {.title}

PhotoMosaic is an extention of the `[gallery]` shortcode.  Any `[gallery]` can become a PhotoMosaic simply by specifying the 'template' --> `[gallery template="photomosaic"]`.  Now your images will render in a mosaic instead of a grid.

See [Where do I create/edit my galleries?](#createedit) for more detail.
