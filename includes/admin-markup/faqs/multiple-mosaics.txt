### How do I put multiple mosaics on the same page? {.title}

#### WPv3.4 and lower:

Simply specify a post that has attached images (ID = the ID for the post where the images are attached).

`[gallery theme="photomosaic" id="1"]`  
`[gallery theme="photomosaic" id="2"]`

#### WPv3.5 and newer

You can use the "Create Gallery" flow to generate as many `[gallery theme="photomosaic" ids="1,2,3,4,5"]` shortcodes as you like.  That's all.
