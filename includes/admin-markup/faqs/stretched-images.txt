### Why are my images stretched and distorted? {.title}

This usually means that your image's thumbnail doesn't have the same aspect ratio as the original image.  In order for PhotoMosaic to smoothly switch between different image resolutions it has to assume that all of the variations of the image (that Wordpress creates) have the same aspect ratio.


#### Wordpressâ€™s Gallery Users

Go to your Media Settings (Settings > Media).  If "Crop thumbnail to exact dimensions (normally thumbnails are proportional)" is checked that's the source of your problem.  To fix it you'll need to uncheck that box, save those changes, and then regenerate your thumbnails. 

To regenerate your thumbnails I recommend the "Regenerate Thumbnails" plugin by Viper007Bond.  Once installed and activated, you can regenerate all of your thumbnails by going to Tools (Tools > Regen. Thumbnails) and clicking the button.  This will replace all of your cropped thumbnails with the new uncropped version.

If you want to regenerate the thumbnails for specific images, this can be done in the Media Library (Media > Library) by selecting the images you wish to regenerate and choosing "Regenerate Thumbnails" in the "Bulk Actions" menu.


#### NextGen Gallery Users

Go to your Gallery Options (Gallery > Options).  If "Set Fixed Dimension" is checked that's the source of your problem.  To fix it you'll need to uncheck that box, save those changes, and regenerate your thumbnails.

To regenerate your thumbnails go to the "Manage Gallery" page, select all of your images, and choose "Create New Thumbnails" from the "Bulk Actions" menu.
