Thank you for purchasing PhotoMosaic-for-Wordpress.

Simply upload the included zip file (photomosaic-for-wordpress.zip), activate, and enjoy.

Once activated, on the last page of the "Create Gallery" flow ("Edit Gallery") you'll see an option called "Theme".  Select "PhotoMosaic" from that drop down and your Wordpress Gallery will display as a PhotoMosaic.

More detailed documentation can be found in the PhotoMosaic Settings panel.

If you have questions you can ask them publicly here (http://codecanyon.net/item/photomosaic-for-wordpress/discussion/243422) or you can contact me directly via the form on my author page (http://codecanyon.net/user/makfak).

Thanks.
Mike
